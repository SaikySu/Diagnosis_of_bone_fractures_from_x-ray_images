# Diagnosis_of_bone_fractures_from_x-ray_images
 
## Introduction
This project builds and compares two Computer Vision models (YOLO and Faster R-CNN) in the problem of bone fracture recognition on the [Bone Fracture Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bone-fracture-detection-computer-vision-project/data) dataset from Kagge.

## Why this project have 2 model?
### 1. About YOLO
I initially chose the YOLO model for my first experiment because it was one of the earliest computer vision models I had worked with, and I was fairly familiar with its implementation. Given that the dataset had already been pre-processed, I believed YOLO would perform reasonably well.

However, the outcome was far from what I expected—the results were significantly poor. When I discussed this with my instructor, they quickly ruled out the use of YOLO for this particular task and encouraged me to explore more suitable alternatives. That’s when I turned to Faster R-CNN, which proved to be a better fit for the problem.
